Instructions for using the code

MC.m is the main file with the code of the simulations for 5 time periods.
Loglik2_T5.m is the corresponding log-likelihood function.
All the other files are utilities called by the code for the computation of the log-determinant, for computing the standard errors, etc√â (references and usage are described therein).

To use the code for empirical applications, load the data in the MC file modifying the code including new rows for the number of X and Z variables needed as well as for the number of time periods. At the moment, the MC file just considers one X variable and one Z variable. Then, add them also in the equations in the log-likelihood function.
